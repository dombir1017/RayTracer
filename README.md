# RayTracer

- A ray tracing implementation based heavily off of Peter Shirley's book ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
- I did this as a way of learning C++ and also to get a better understanding of the ray tracing algorithm.
- The only major difference between the book's version and mine is the addition of multithreading in order to improve performance.
